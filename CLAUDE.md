# CLAUDE.md

The repo lives on the external SSD at
`/Volumes/T7 Shield/INSEA/Projects/framopia-studio`; the drive has to be
mounted before anything works. Test footage sits inside it under
`my files/test videos/` and is gitignored — never commit video or audio.

Operating memory for Claude Code sessions on this repo. Keep this file in
sync with what actually exists — update it at the end of every session.

## What this is

Framopia Studio: an internal After Effects automation tool for a
two-person Moroccan video agency. It turns a finished talking-head reel
into an AE composition with animated subtitles, emphasized keywords,
AI-generated contextual images, SFX, and a watermark. Full spec in
`docs/PROJECT_SPEC.md`.

## Repo map

- `docs/` — locked spec, architecture, orthography, template library guide
- `handoffs/` — session handoff documents
- `reports/` — per-session work reports
- `panel/` — After Effects CEP panel (not started)
- `service/` — Node/TypeScript companion service
- `benchmarks/` — transcription benchmark harness (Scribe, Gemini, local
  Whisper baseline, Scribe+Gemini hybrid), scored on WER, orthography
  conformance, and cross-engine timestamp deviation. See `benchmarks/README.md`.
- `tools/cv/`, `tools/validate-templates/` — helper scripts (not started)
- `templates/`, `modes/` — AE templates and per-client config (not started)
- `assets/brand/`, `assets/watermark/`, `assets/sfx/` — shared assets (not started)
- `.local/` — machine-local config, secrets, run state (gitignored, never committed)

## Commands

- `npm run check` (repo root) — typecheck + lint + test for `service/` and
  `benchmarks/`. This is the regression gate; it must pass before any
  commit that touches code.
- Start the service: `npm run build --prefix service && npm run start --prefix service`.
  On start it writes `.local/service.json` with `{ port, token }`.
- Run the transcription benchmark: `npm run bench -- --audio <abs path>
  (--ground-truth <path.json> | --no-ground-truth)` (add `--dry-run` to
  exercise the harness against fixtures with no network calls, or `--yes` to
  skip the interactive cost confirmation). Paths resolve relative to
  `benchmarks/`, so pass absolute ones from the repo root. See
  `benchmarks/README.md` for the ground-truth format and full flag list.
  `--no-ground-truth` is the unscored mode: engines run, orthography
  conformance and spotchecks still happen, WER columns are dropped from the
  report rather than filled with zeros. Use it for any reel with no
  hand-written transcript.
  `benchmarks/whisper/setup.sh` installs the local Whisper baseline
  (Apple Silicon only, not run by `npm run check`).
- `npm run bench:tag` — turn the hand-written `.local/ground-truth/*.txt`
  transcripts into tagged ground-truth JSON.
- `npm run bench:aggregate` — rescore every reel's latest run from disk (no
  API calls) into `benchmarks/RESULTS-block1.md`.

## Conventions (binding — see docs/CLAUDE_CODE_GUIDELINES.md)

- No AI attribution anywhere: no "Generated with Claude Code", no
  "Co-Authored-By: Claude", no AI-tool banners in commits, code, or docs.
- Conventional commits: `feat: …`, `fix: …`, `chore: …`, `docs: …`,
  `test: …`. Lowercase after the colon, imperative mood, subject ≤72 chars.
  Small, coherent commits.
- Comments only where a human would write one — explain non-obvious why,
  never what. No decorative banners, no emoji anywhere.
- Secrets (API keys, tokens) live only in `.local/`, which is gitignored.
  Never log secret values. `config.example.json` at repo root documents
  the shape of `.local/config.json` with placeholder values.

## Status

**Block 1 transcription is complete and the config is frozen.** The freeze
record — chosen config, run C numbers, why each alternative lost, and the
caveats it carries — is `docs/DECISION-transcription-config.md`, which is the
Block 1 definition-of-done evidence. `docs/PROJECT_SPEC.md` §7 points at it.

Frozen config: **hybrid** — Scribe v2 batch for word timings and a first
pass, then a Gemini `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` correction pass carrying
`docs/ORTHOGRAPHY_GUIDE.md` (**v1.0.3, frozen**) plus the per-word script
rules, realigned onto Scribe's timings by Levenshtein anchoring with linear
interpolation across inserted words.

Also done: repo scaffold, docs, the `service/` skeleton, the `benchmarks/`
harness, four scored reels in `benchmarks/footage.json` with audio in
`.local/bench-audio/`, hand-written ground truth for all four in
`.local/ground-truth/`, and three scoring passes recorded side by side —
`RESULTS-block1-runA.md` (v1.0.1), `-runB.md` (v1.0.2 rescore),
`RESULTS-block1.md` (**run C, v1.0.3, the run of record**).

`benchmarks/footage.json` holds a fifth reel, `vitasilk` (25.7 s, second
speaker, hair-product domain, one-off test footage rather than a client). It
has **no ground truth**, so it runs with `--no-ground-truth` and is
deliberately absent from `REELS` in `benchmarks/src/aggregate.ts`, which
scores WER. Its unscored run is `benchmarks/RESULTS-block2-robustness.md`.

Three facts that shape everything downstream:

- **Scribe returns Darija in Arabic script, not Arabizi.** Transliteration is
  the Gemini pass's job (`benchmarks/src/engines/script-rules.ts`).
- **Gemini bills thinking tokens at the output rate**, ~5x the visible
  output on these reels. `computeGeminiCost` counts them; any new Gemini
  caller must too, or it under-reports by that factor. Budget $0.35–0.55
  per 90s reel.
- **Gemini's self-reported timestamps drift** — 9/15 by ear against hybrid's
  14/15, worsening through a reel. This, not WER, is why the config is
  hybrid.

**Block 2 (transcription production pipeline) is in progress.** Done so far:
the Block 1 handoff in `handoffs/block-1.md`, a ledger correction for the one
understated Gemini entry from Block 1 session 4 (see the ledger note at the
end of `benchmarks/RESULTS-block1.md` — the raw 19:50:06 line is known-low and
must never be quoted as an actual cost), and the robustness run above. No
production pipeline code yet. Panel, templates, and real job types are not
started.

See `docs/BLOCKS.md` for the full block plan and `handoffs/` for prior
session context.
