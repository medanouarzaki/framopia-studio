# CLAUDE.md

The repo lives on the external SSD at
`/Volumes/T7 Shield/INSEA/Projects/framopia-studio`; the drive has to be
mounted before anything works. Test footage sits inside it under
`my files/test videos/` and is gitignored — never commit video or audio.

Operating memory for Claude Code sessions on this repo. Keep this file in
sync with what actually exists — update it at the end of every session.

## What this is

Framopia Studio: an internal After Effects automation tool for a
two-person Moroccan video agency. It turns a finished talking-head reel
into an AE composition with animated subtitles, emphasized keywords,
AI-generated contextual images, SFX, and a watermark. Full spec in
`docs/PROJECT_SPEC.md`.

## Repo map

- `docs/` — locked spec, architecture, orthography, template library guide
- `handoffs/` — session handoff documents
- `reports/` — per-session work reports
- `panel/` — After Effects CEP panel (not started)
- `core/` — `@framopia/core`, the shared workspace package: config loading,
  the cost ledger, pricing constants and the Gemini model pin
  (`core/src/model-config.json`), the token normalizer, the Levenshtein
  aligner, and `SCRIPT_RULES`. Anything both `service/` and `benchmarks/`
  need lives here; nothing is duplicated across the two any more.
- `service/` — Node/TypeScript companion service. `service/src/transcription/`
  holds the production hybrid module (see Status).
- `benchmarks/` — transcription benchmark harness (Scribe, Gemini, local
  Whisper baseline, Scribe+Gemini hybrid), scored on WER, orthography
  conformance, and cross-engine timestamp deviation. See `benchmarks/README.md`.
- `tools/cv/`, `tools/validate-templates/` — helper scripts (not started)
- `templates/`, `modes/` — AE templates and per-client config (not started)
- `assets/brand/`, `assets/watermark/`, `assets/sfx/` — shared assets (not started)
- `.local/` — machine-local config, secrets, run state (gitignored, never committed)

## Commands

- The repo is an npm workspace (`core`, `service`, `benchmarks`). Install
  once at the root; there are no per-package lockfiles.
- `npm run check` (repo root) — builds `@framopia/core`, then typecheck +
  lint + test across every workspace. This is the regression gate; it must
  pass before any commit that touches code. `core` builds to `core/dist/`
  and the other packages import the built output, so anything that runs
  workspace code builds core first.
- Start the service: `npm run build:core && npm run build --prefix service && npm run start --prefix service`.
  On start it writes `.local/service.json` with `{ port, token }`.
- Run the transcription benchmark: `npm run bench -- --audio <abs path>
  (--ground-truth <path.json> | --no-ground-truth)` (add `--dry-run` to
  exercise the harness against fixtures with no network calls, or `--yes` to
  skip the interactive cost confirmation). Paths resolve relative to
  `benchmarks/`, so pass absolute ones from the repo root. See
  `benchmarks/README.md` for the ground-truth format and full flag list.
  `--no-ground-truth` is the unscored mode: engines run, orthography
  conformance and spotchecks still happen, WER columns are dropped from the
  report rather than filled with zeros. Use it for any reel with no
  hand-written transcript.
  `benchmarks/whisper/setup.sh` installs the local Whisper baseline
  (Apple Silicon only, not run by `npm run check`).
- `npm run transcribe -- --video <abs path> [--out <path.json>] [--keyterms
  <path>] [--yes]` — the production path end to end: ffmpeg audio extraction
  (`-vn -ac 1 -ar 16000 -c:a pcm_s16le`), Scribe, the correction pass,
  alignment, and a transcript artifact written to
  `.local/transcripts/<name>.json`. Billable; prints an estimate and asks for
  confirmation unless `--yes`. The same code runs behind the `transcribe` job
  type on the HTTP path, so the two cannot diverge. It writes a plain
  transcript, **not** an Edit Plan — that schema is not built yet.
- The conformance scorer also flags a standalone `ou` (the conjunction و is
  `w`, §2) and any Latin Arabizi token with no vowel at all (§3 wants an `e`
  where dropping one leaves an unreadable cluster). The vowel rule currently
  over-fires on ordinary Arabizi (`ymkn`, `ch3rk`, `jbt`) — see
  `reports/block-2-session-4.md`; narrowing it is a pending user decision.
- The Gemini cost **estimate** is deliberately pessimistic
  (`THINKING_TOKEN_MULTIPLIER = 15`) because it feeds a spend gate; observed
  thinking ratios run 5x–30.2x. Actuals always come from `usageMetadata` and
  are never estimated.
- `npm run bench:tag` — turn the hand-written `.local/ground-truth/*.txt`
  transcripts into tagged ground-truth JSON.
- `npm run bench:aggregate` — rescore every reel's latest run from disk (no
  API calls) into `benchmarks/RESULTS-block1.md`.

## Conventions (binding — see docs/CLAUDE_CODE_GUIDELINES.md)

- No AI attribution anywhere: no "Generated with Claude Code", no
  "Co-Authored-By: Claude", no AI-tool banners in commits, code, or docs.
- Conventional commits: `feat: …`, `fix: …`, `chore: …`, `docs: …`,
  `test: …`. Lowercase after the colon, imperative mood, subject ≤72 chars.
  Small, coherent commits.
- Comments only where a human would write one — explain non-obvious why,
  never what. No decorative banners, no emoji anywhere.
- Secrets (API keys, tokens) live only in `.local/`, which is gitignored.
  Never log secret values. `config.example.json` at repo root documents
  the shape of `.local/config.json` with placeholder values.

## Status

**Block 1 transcription is complete and the config is frozen.** The freeze
record — chosen config, run C numbers, why each alternative lost, and the
caveats it carries — is `docs/DECISION-transcription-config.md`, which is the
Block 1 definition-of-done evidence. `docs/PROJECT_SPEC.md` §7 points at it.

Frozen config: **hybrid** — Scribe v2 batch for word timings and a first
pass, then a Gemini `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` correction pass carrying
`docs/ORTHOGRAPHY_GUIDE.md` (**v1.0.4, frozen**) plus the per-word script
rules, realigned onto Scribe's timings by Levenshtein anchoring with linear
interpolation across inserted words.

Also done: repo scaffold, docs, the `service/` skeleton, the `benchmarks/`
harness, four scored reels in `benchmarks/footage.json` with audio in
`.local/bench-audio/`, hand-written ground truth for all four in
`.local/ground-truth/`, and three scoring passes recorded side by side —
`RESULTS-block1-runA.md` (v1.0.1), `-runB.md` (v1.0.2 rescore),
`RESULTS-block1.md` (**run C, v1.0.3, the run of record**).

`benchmarks/footage.json` holds a fifth reel, `vitasilk` (25.7 s, second
speaker, hair-product domain, one-off test footage rather than a client). It
has **no ground truth**, so it runs with `--no-ground-truth` and is
deliberately absent from `REELS` in `benchmarks/src/aggregate.ts`, which
scores WER. Its unscored run is `benchmarks/RESULTS-block2-robustness.md`.

Three facts that shape everything downstream:

- **Scribe returns Darija in Arabic script, not Arabizi.** Transliteration is
  the Gemini pass's job (`benchmarks/src/engines/script-rules.ts`).
- **Gemini bills thinking tokens at the output rate**, ~5x the visible
  output on these reels. `computeGeminiCost` counts them; any new Gemini
  caller must too, or it under-reports by that factor. Budget $0.35–0.55
  per 90s reel.
- **Gemini's self-reported timestamps drift** — 9/15 by ear against hybrid's
  14/15, worsening through a reel. This, not WER, is why the config is
  hybrid.

**Block 2 (transcription production pipeline) is in progress.** Done so far:
the Block 1 handoff in `handoffs/block-1.md`; a ledger correction for the one
understated Gemini entry from Block 1 session 4 (see the ledger note at the
end of `benchmarks/RESULTS-block1.md` — the raw 19:50:06 line is known-low and
must never be quoted as an actual cost); the robustness run above; the npm
workspace and `@framopia/core`; three benchmark fixes (dry-run costs from the
real input duration, dry runs no longer touch the stable spotcheck mirror,
and an exact freeze-list hit is never reported as a near-miss of a
neighbour); and the production hybrid module.

`service/src/transcription/` — `scribe.ts` (Scribe v2 batch client),
`correction.ts` (the Gemini correction pass), `align.ts` (anchor alignment of
corrected text onto Scribe timings), `drift.ts`, `cost.ts`, `media.ts`,
`job.ts` (the `transcribe` job runner), `index.ts` (`transcribeHybrid`), plus
the post-processing stages `tagging.ts`, `cleaning.ts` and `grouping.ts`.
It has no fallback path: if the correction pass fails it throws a structured
`TranscriptionError`, because returning the Scribe draft would hand back
Arabic-script Darija labelled as a hybrid result.

`transcribeHybrid` requires the audio duration, because Scribe bills per
audio-hour and its response carries none. It returns a **cost breakdown**
(`scribeUsd`, `geminiUsd`, `totalUsd`) so no caller has to remember to add a
component, prints an estimate before the first billable call, and appends
**two** ledger lines — stages `transcribe-scribe` and
`transcribe-gemini-correction`. It also returns a **token-count drift**
record (draft count, corrected count, delta, fraction); past 15% — a starting
threshold chosen without evidence — it adds a `TranscriptionWarning`. A
high-drift correction is flagged, never dropped.

**Prompt versions.** `ACTIVE_PROMPT_VERSION` in `correction.ts` is the
prompt's identity and will feed the cache fingerprint (ARCHITECTURE §6).
**Version 1 is active** — the Block 1 frozen prompt, verbatim, and the only
version any evidence describes. Version 2 (version 1 plus a `و` → `w` rule,
keyterms moved ahead of the JSON-shape instruction) stays selectable as the
record of the session-3 experiment but is not used: that comparison
(`benchmarks/RESULTS-block2-promptv2.md`) was inconclusive, having varied two
things at once and run each arm once. The reversion is recorded as an
amendment in `docs/DECISION-transcription-config.md`. The `ou` corruption is
now caught by the conformance scorer instead of a prompt rule.

**The noise floor is 2.5 WER points.** Three identical correction calls — same
recorded draft, same audio, same prompt — gave 21.0%, 21.0% and 18.5% overall
WER, with 69 of 81 tokens identical and cost varying 41%
(`benchmarks/RESULTS-block2-noisefloor.md`). Any prompt comparison whose
effect is smaller than that is not measurable at n=1 on this reel. Every
moving token was an orthography choice, not a hearing disagreement.

**Post-processing** (all pure, no API): `tagging.ts` derives `script` from the
characters and leaves `lang` **null** when the correction pass does not report
it — which is every word under the current prompt, and deliberately not
defaulted to `darija`. `cleaning.ts` flags `euh`/`eh` fillers and immediate
stutters with `removed`/`removedReason` and never deletes; `ya3ni`/`za3ma` are
reported as unjudged rather than guessed, and non-repetition false starts are
not attempted. `grouping.ts` builds 1–2 word subtitle groups from `wordIds`,
pairing when the gap is ≤180 ms and the span ≤1.2 s, skipping removed words
but still counting their audio in the gap. Alignment carries Scribe's
per-slot confidence onto anchored words and leaves interpolated words at
`null`.

**Edit Plan v1** lives in `service/src/editplan/` — `types.ts` (the whole
ARCHITECTURE §3 shape), `validate.ts` (structural validation returning issues
with dotted paths, plus `EditPlanVersionError` for an unknown
`schemaVersion`), `io.ts` (`createEditPlan`, `readEditPlan`, `writeEditPlan`,
and `<video-dir>/<video-name>.editplan.json`). Keywords, images, zones, sfx
and build have types and empty containers only — the stages that fill them do
not exist. Nothing writes a plan yet; the CLI still emits a plain transcript.

Two deliberate departures from ARCHITECTURE §3, both to avoid recording a
guess as data: `transcript.words[].lang` is nullable, and `clientMode` and
`watermark` are nullable because transcription runs before either is chosen.

Panel, templates, and real job types are not started.

See `docs/BLOCKS.md` for the full block plan and `handoffs/` for prior
session context.
